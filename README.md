# quantum-state-preparation
A project aimed to perform a comparative analysis of various algorithms for quantum state manipulation. 

The code simply requires a Python compiler and a few packages, including tensorflow, matplotlib installed. To run the Deep 
Learning agent, one only needs to run "run_this_multi_act.py"
